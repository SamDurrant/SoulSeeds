# Soul Seeds
A subscription-based website where users can sign up for monthly or yearly services.   
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live Demo

A live demo has been deployed on Netlify at [Snaps](https://snaps.netlify.com/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Motivation

The concept for this project was inspired by conversations with a friend. Mostly, I really wanted to work on a few different skills.
>### **Technical Goals**
> 1. Create a project utilizing React. Up until this point, I had only worked on tutorials or smaller projects.
> 2. Focus on breaking my project into components and working on identifying what makes a component.
>### **Design Goals**
>1. Developing the project in a more efficient manner and working on time my time management skills
>2.  While I feel confident in my CSS skills, I wanted to work on my design skills, so I used [Misfits Market](https://www.misfitsmarket.com/) as inspiration.
>3. Design from mobile first

## Technologies

* CSS
* React

## Features

* Menu and Cart both slide in from the side
* Items can be added or removed from the cart

## Challenges

* Getting the blobs in the background to position themselves correctly, especially with window resizing.
* Learning how to navigate a project with a larger folder structure than I am accustomed to has been a bit of a learning curve, but I do feel more confident after taking on this project.
